# Data Science Projects
in this repo I'll show and upload my Data Science/ Data Analyst/ Data Engineering Projects 

1- Data Cleaning and ETL: Building a Data Pipeline
Pipeline Overview
Extract: Fetch weather data for all cities using an API.
Transform:
Clean the data (handle missing/invalid values).
Perform feature engineering (e.g., calculate average temperature).
Add derived metrics (e.g., temperature ranges).
Cluster cities based on weather patterns.
Perform a weather-based forecast.
Load: Save the cleaned and enriched data into a database.

2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization are critical steps in understanding a retail dataset.
Load the Dataset
  Import the retail dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
  Examine the dataset's structure and properties.
Understand the Data
  Shape of Data: Number of rows and columns.
  Data Types: Identify categorical and numerical columns.
  Missing Values: Check for null or missing data.
  Basic Statistics: Calculate mean, median, max, min, etc.
Analyze Key Columns
  Customer Behavior: Analyze customer-related columns like frequency, recency, and spending.
  Product Analysis: Identify the best-selling and least popular products.
  Time-based Trends: Analyze sales patterns over time (daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal).
Visualize Insights
  Use appropriate visualizations for each analysis:
  Bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.
